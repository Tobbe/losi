VTray 1.10
by Vendicator (http://vendicator.shellfront.org | vendicator@mail.com)

VTray is a rewrite of the indiestep Systray2.
That code base had grown too large and was too hard to maintain,
which is why this module has been built using classes.
Also the cleaner code has allowed for easier addition of new
features, such as the icon scrolling.
Loads as a normal desktop module, in Wharf or LsBox.


Loading the module:
	Extract the vtray.dll file to either your LiteStep dir, or
	the modules directory of the theme which you are currently
	using. Add a LoadModule line to configure LiteStep to load
	the module such as:

	LoadModule	"$LiteStepDir$vtray.dll"
	If the module is located in the LiteStep directory, Or

	LoadModule	"$ModulesDir$vtray.dll"
	if the module is in the modules dir of the theme.

	Also you should make sure that there is no conflict with another
	tray module, so comment out any LoadModule lines for Systray2 by
	placing a ; in front of the line.
	Eg:	;LoadModule	"$LiteStepDir$Systray2.dll"


Step.rc Settings:
	By default VTray looks for settings such as VTrayX, VTrayWidth,
	but in order to make an upgrade easier a special setting has been
	added to order VTray to look for the old Systray2 settings.
	In the documentation this will be represented as [Tray]X, which means
	SystrayX, if the settings compability flag is set, otherwise VTrayX.

	VTraySettingsCompatibility
	Define the settings prefix [Tray] as Systray, as opposed to VTray,
	so VTray will instead look for SystrayX, SystrayWidth etc.
