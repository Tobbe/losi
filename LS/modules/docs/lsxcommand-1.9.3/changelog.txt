   Changelog:
   ==========
   
   Version 1.9.3 (Eddie/rabidcow)
   -------------
  
     New Features
     ````````````
         - CommandNoTrailingZeros - Prevents the trailing zeros when using 
	   the calculator.
	 - CommandCalcPrecision - Sets the precision of the calculator
	   (Sig Figs) Default: 6 (as per 1.9.2).
	 - CommandMarginLeft, CommandMarginRight - Sets the margins of the 
	   edit box. Default: 0.

     Bug fixes
     `````````
         - History now works!! 
	 - File autocompletion fixed.
	 - The edit box now shows the last character properly when auto-
	   scrolling.
	 - History entries are no longer one more than CommandHistoryEntries. 

     Changes
     ```````
     	- Microcomplete now stops at the backslash character, as well as at a
	  space like it did before (so you can microcomplete pathnames).
	- Made lsxcommand focus the topmost window (which isn't a "tool" 
	  window) when it is hidden.
	- If CommandTabFileComplete is enabled, and CommandNoTabMicroComplete 
	  is set, the Tab key can now also be used to autocomplete files.


   Version 1.9.2 (rabidcow)
   -------------

     New Features
     ````````````
         - CommandOn... for everything that had a custom event and Quit.

     Bug fixes
     `````````
         - History browsing goes the right way now.

   Version 1.9.1 (rabidcow)
   -------------

     New Features
     ````````````
         - better error messages, unless you turn them off
         - CommandWrapHistory will make history wrap, like in 1.9.0
         - pgup/pgdn/ctrl+home/ctrl+end move in history list now

     Bug fixes
     `````````
         - CommandAssumeNetAddress should work again
         - CommandNoWarnOnError should work again (and not setting it)
         - executing stuff should work better  (not sure how to explain it, I
           made some bad assumptions about the return values of LSExecute)
         - you can set a position to 9 in CommandContextMenuOrder and it will
           not cause a (check settings) in the menu
         - CommandSearchEngineBrowser should work again
         - history does not wrap by default
         - a command consisting of nothing aside from whitespace will not
           break the history list on restart

     Changes
     ```````
         - history is written to the file after every command instead of just
           on exit (and in !CommandClearHistory)

   Version 1.9.0 (rabidcow)
   -------------

     Note
     ````
         Most of the fixes in 1.8.6 were fixed in parallel or rendered
         irrelevant by a larger structural change, so 1.8.6 changes may not be
         exactly present in 1.9.0 (and may be duplicated below).
         Exceptions are:

         - GetPrivateProfileString change (heavily modified because of the
           rewritten history list code), although I think that just treated
           the symptom rather than curing it, the rewrite should've killed it.
           (hey, I need some excuse now that I've done all that work...)
         - CommandHideOnEsc

         (VarExpansionEx change was not merged in because MAX_LINE_LENGTH is
         the default maximum for VarExpansion, so it won't make a difference.)

     New Features
     ````````````
         - !CommandSize: Change the size of the command box.
		   also "!CommandSize home"
		 - !CommandShowText: Like !CommandSetText, but without setting focus.
		 - *CommandChar: single-char aliases like ? and =
		 - !CommandCalculate: perform calculation, default for =
		 - !CommandSearch: perform search, default for ?
		 - The default search engine has a check mark next to it in the menu.
           (assuming that you set the default near the beginning of the file)
         - Aliases can be organized into categories, and can use <args>
         - CommandTextAlign left|center|right
         - you can use "*CommandAlias stop" to end the alias list

     Bug fixes
     `````````
         - Removed some sizeof(char) where pointer arithmatic handles it
           (sizeof(char) == 1 by definition, but still...)
		 - buffer overflow reading settings, apparently was extra naughty on
		   purels
		 - (jesus_mjjg) OnUnfocus should now work when HideOnUnfocus is not
		   set
		 - there was a remote possibility that certain OnUnfocus commands
		   could cause litestep to "stop responding to messages", fixed.
         - The context menu will show up over the edit box when you press the
           "app" key.

     Changes
     ```````
		 - Stores new entries to history list before $constant$ expansion
		 - !CommandMove uses more standardishly arguments
		 - CommandTransparentEditBox is almost obsolete.  Now using flicker-
		   free method, which doesn't really work on Win95 (not supported by
		   OS), but works better everywhere else.  Still not perfect
		   unfortunately, no idea why.
		 - Docs/XML converted to lsmd-0.3p "unofficial" format ;)
		   (xslt included to convert back to lsdoc)
		 - Much cleanup and fixes of evil code.  "atoi(&atom)" indeed...
		 - Reimplemented search engine and alias lists with hash tables.
		   These now use common code for a lot of things, so you can have
		   categorized menus for aliases and load the search engine list
		   from step.rc (aliases from a file are also possible, but there's
		   no setting for it yet.)  Both should also run faster, but you
           almost certainly won't notice.
		 - Reimplemented history and autocomplete file lists with a cleaner,
		   clearer code structure.
		 - Context menu implementation now restricts you to 8192 (each)
		   history entries, aliases, and search engines, but I think you'd
		   have to worry about resource usage before then.  (You can have
		   more, but the context menu won't work right for more than that.)
		   Also, aliases and search engines are now limited to a maximum of 8
		   categories deep.  (an arbitrary limit to make the code easier)
         - added macro to project to help creating those tedious function
           comment blocks in MSVC6.

   Version 1.8.6 (29.03.2004; jugg/Seg@)
   -------------
     Bug fixes
     `````````
         - jugg's buffer size bugfix added
           (no more crash if CommandOnFocus and CommandOnUnfocus actions contain
           more than 255 characters)
         - custom cz_LCTokenize function replaced with a call of LS core's
           LCTokenize (they are similar!)
         - HistoryInit() rewritten using GetPrivateProfileString() API call.
           Custom implementation of procs that are available in the Windows
           kernel is at least strange thing :)
           Also it would solve a problem with unknown spaces.
           (Windows think that spaces is a part of comment and left them in
           WritePrivateProfileString call (i.e. when modules.ini is written on
           !Quit), but on the next LS start HistoryInit() reads these spaces as
           a part of command, usually other, since numbers changed :) )
         - History is now written before eVar expansion. Is there anybody
           who think that
           !alert "X:\Documents and Settings\Seg@\Desktop\"
           is more informative that
           !alert "$Desktop$" ?
         - VarExpansion changed to VarExpansionEx.
           Don't know about fanatics who can type very long strings with
           very long eVars, but everything can be...
         - Fixed typos in managing transparent edit boxes
           (don't know how it works though :) )

     New Features

	 - (rabidcow) Fixed some resource leaks.

   Version 1.8.3 (jesus_mjjg)
   -------------
     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - If lsxcommand was loaded in a box, CommandStartHidden wouldn't work,
	   now it does.

     New Features
     ````````````
     - CommandOnFocus
       Will execute a command when you !FocusCommand
     - CommandOnUnfocus
       Will execute a command when you un-focus lsxcommand (get out of the
	   edit box)
     - Now there is a module version in the about box/ls control panel

   Special Version for lsbox 2.75

     ````````````
     - !CommandBoxHook
       This is used with lsbox:

     - Fixed locality stuff for international users

   Version 1.7.9
   -------------
     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed DarkStep Compatibility
     - Linked against a fresh lsapi.dll, so this *should* fix problems
       people had loading LSXCommand 1.7.8.  Drop me a line if not

   Version 1.7.8
   -------------
     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Calculator documentation entirely revamped to reflect all the new
       and cool features - CHECK IT OUT!
     - Added lsxcommand.rc to the package - just a list of all the
       RC commands and !Bang commands.
     - Documentation reflects new location of the Japanese translation

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - AutoComplete bug is fixed!  The fix *might* make AutoComplete work
       not *exactly* as planned, but at least it won't crash any more.

     New Features
     ````````````
     - New Timer management
     - Entirely new calculator code (Mad props to Jonas Sicking for coding
       this stuff - credit entirely belongs to him for the calculator now)

   Version 1.7.7
   -------------
     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - It turns out Mr. Kawamoto isn't a Professor after all ("merely
       a student" to put it in his words).  Well, at least he's a
       Ph. D. candidate :)
     - Kudos section fixed & updated - check out the new entry.
     - Updated CommandClock section to include new !Bangs supported
       by LSXCommandClock

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed CommandNoWarnOnError bug when entering a path
     - !CommandMove now automatically calls !FocusCommand *if*
       it was called without any arguments (ie you want it to move to
       the current mouse position)
     - Aliases now properly parse out stuff like the following:
       *CommandAlias IE "C:\program files\internet explorer\..."
       Thanks to TAMUKI-TAM for sending the patch to this bug.

     New Features
     ````````````
     - LSXCommand is now offered in Japanese.. TAMUKI-TAM is the guy
       who localized LSXCommand to use Japanese characters and
       Mr. Kawamoto, as I said before, has translated the readme to
       Japanese - thanks again!
     - Added following !Bang commands (see section II.3 for details):

       * !CommandToggleTimer / !CommandClockToggleTimer
       * !CommandSetText

   Version 1.7.6
   -------------

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Kudos section has a few new entries - check them out!
     - CommandBorderSize documentation added

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed !CommandMove bug
     - Fixed Working Directory problems

     New Features
     ````````````
     - When !CommandMove/!CommandClockMove is called without
       parameters, it moves to the current cursor position.  I would
       recommend using CommandHideOnUnfocus with this.
       Also, if you !CommandMove has the parameter "home", it moves
       back to the original position found in step.rc
     - Added following RC Commands:

       * Command + Bottom | Top | Left | Right + BorderSize
         (ie. CommandTopBorderSize, CommandLeftBorderSize...)

     Notes
     `````
     Be *sure* to read the CommandBorderSize documentation if you
     are interested in using CommandBottom/Top/Left/RightBorderSize

   Version 1.7.5
   -------------
   More bug fixes; new features

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Fixed Ilkka Nisula's name.
     - Updated Search Engine list documentation to reflect
       "categories"
     - Updated Section II.1 to note that new engines are only added
       to the master search engine list available on my web site.

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed !CommandBrowse* crashes

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Added Mike Thrall's code for moving LSXCommand via a !Bang
       (see below)
     - Added category feature to Search Engine list (see the end of
       section II.1 for details)
     - Added following !Bang Commands:

     - Added following Search Engines (see section II.1 for details)

       * DVDExpress
       * CodeGuru
       * ZDNet HotFiles

   Version 1.7.4
   -------------
   Bug fixes, bug fixes, bug fixes...

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Documentation now reflects change from CommandClock to
       CommandTime

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed AlterScript to work like Killarny's script.dll
       Meaning, understanding the LoadScript RC Commands
     - Fixed !CommandBrowseFile & !CommandBrowseFolder crashing bugs
     - Fixed CommandCommaDelimiter problems (stupid infinite loops)
     - Fixed the weird LSXCommand/CommandClock problem: if you have
       the *original* LSXCommand with a CommandClock entry, then
       you must change this to CommandTime (see Notes for more info)

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Added switch WinAmp/Clock mode on mouse click in
       LSXCommandClock (not in LSXCommand).
     - Added following RC Commands:

       * CommandAddExternalsToHistory

     - Added following search engines:

       * AudioFindMP3 (MP3 search engine - audiofind.com)
       * PalaVista    (MP3 metacrawler - palavista.com)

     Notes
     `````
     It turns out the problem lies in LSAPI, and not LSXCommand or
     LSXCommandClock.  In any case, the original CommandClock RC
     Command (before there ever was a LSXCommandClock) now is named
     CommandTime.  The LSXCommandClock RC Command "CommandClockString"
     is still the same.  So, if you have the original LSXCommand still
     with a CommandClock entry, change it to CommandTime.  NOTE:
     CommandClockDisappearsOnFocus is still the same.

       Example: CommandClock "#c"  -->  CommandTime "#c"

   Version 1.7.3
   -------------
   A couple of features, bug fixes

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed File AutoComplete junk characters error

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Separate AlterScript module (see section II.11 for details)
     - Separate clock module (see section II.10 for details)
     - Added following !Bang Commands:

       * !CommandBrowseFile
       * !CommandBrowseFolder

   Version 1.7.2
   -------------
   Mostly bug fixes & two feature additions

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Added section II.9 for Tab File Completion feature

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed !CommandHide & !CommandShow problems
     - Fixed CommandHiddenOnStart problems (again)
     - Fixed Paste menu item problems

     New Features
     ````````````
     - New positioning system (see Notes below)
     - Added file name tab completion like Re5ource's popups
       (see section II.9)
     - Added following RC Commands (see section II.2 for details)

       * CommandSearchEngineBrowser
       * CommandWinAmpDisappearsOnFocus
       * CommandHideOnUnfocus
       * CommandTabFileComplete
       * CommandOffsetX
       * CommandOffsetY

     Notes
     `````
     In the new positioning system, CommandOffsetX/Y are used to
     decide from where LSXCommand should compute its position.  The
     following table lists the combinations of CommandOffsetX/Y and
     CommandX/Y and what they do:

       CommandOffsetX/Y:
         0  -  Reference from Left/Top (default)
         1  -  Reference from Center of Horizontal/Vertical
         2  -  Reference from Right/Bottom

       CommandX/Y:
         These values now tell how many pixels away from the point
         described by CommandOffsetX/Y LSXCommand should be.

     For instance, using the following values will have LSXCommand
     be placed 2 pixels to the left of horizontal center, at the very
     bottom of the screen:

       CommandOffsetX 1
       CommandOffsetY 2
       CommandX      -2
       CommandY      -14  (Same as negative of CommandHeight)

     If you leave your settings the way they are, they will work as
     before.

     To turn on file name tab completion, be sure to turn *on*
     CommandTabFileComplete and CommandNoTabMicroComplete.  I know
     this is a bit clunky, but deal with it please... :)  I didn't
     test it too extensively, but it seems to be working quite
     well on my system..  Of course, we know what that means...

   Version 1.7.1
   -------------
   Just bug fixes and a few features

     Documentation Changes
     `````````````````````
     - Added number conversion information to Calculator
       Functionality section (section II.6)
     - Added multiple number bases information to Calculator
       Functionality section (section II.6)
     - Changed the original lscommand's readme file.  Many
       people asked about why CommandHideOnStart doesn't work.
       This is because there is no such thing.. it is
       CommandHiddenOnStart.  That solves that mess.

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed Comma Delimiter problem(s)
     - Caught up with the Kudos section of this readme. :)
     - Fixed bug with CommandContextMenuOrder
     - Fixed Clock that never came back after a command
     - Fixed any problems with CommandHiddenOnStart with
       CommandBackground

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Calculator supports limited number converion
     - Calculator supports binary & hexadecimal numbers (see section
       II.6)
     - You can now stop any of the History / Alias / Search Engine
       submenus from coming up by setting them to 9 instead of 0, 1,
       or 2.
     - Added following RC Commands (see section II.2 for details)

       * CommandScrollWinAmpTitle
       * CommandContextMenuStandardItems

     - Added following !Bang Commands (see section II.3 for details)

       * !Command
       * !CommandShow
       * !CommandHide

     - Added following search engines (see section II.1 for details)

       * OLGA  - On-Line Guitar Archive
       * UBL   - Ultimate Band List
       * CDNow - Search for CDs

     Notes
     `````
     CommandScrollWinAmpTitle scrolls the current WinAmp title *if*
     WinAmp's "Scroll Song Title in Windows Taskbar" preference is
     on.  Also, you *can* have a clock and the WinAmp scroller - but
     the WinAmp scroller takes precedence.  Therefore, the WinAmp
     scroller will show when there is a WinAmp to scroll.  If not,
     LSXCommand will show a clock (if the clock setting is specified)

   Version 1.7
   -----------
   New features...

     Documentation Changes

     NOTE: This section notifies you about changes to existing
     documentation.  New documentation is not listed here.  Pay
     close attention to Section II, since all major features have
     their own documentation added under this section.

     - Added note about RPN functionality to Calculator section II.6
     - Added shameless plug <g> for the full engines.list at my web

     `````````
     - Proper handling of border sizes (retheming may be required)

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Added following RC Commands (see section II.2 for details)

       * CommandNoAutoComplete
       * CommandCommaDelimiter
       * CommandTransparentEditBox
       * CommandBackground
       * CommandRPNCalculator
       * CommandClock
       * CommandClockDisappearsOnFocus

     Notes
     `````
     While doing some theming of LSXCommand myself, I noticed that
     when I set BorderSize to 0, it still had a border around it.
     I fixed that kind of stuff in this revision.  NOTE: Some re-
     theming may be required.

     If you set CommandTransparentEditBox on for whatever reason, you
     *WILL* see flashing while typing in the command box.  No doubt.
     I strongly suggest reading section II.2 for more about
     transparency and backgrounds.

   Version 1.5.3
   -------------
   Just a couple of bug fixes in the new command parser from 1.5.2
   and another feature.

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed the junk characters being launched as an Internet
       Address when CommandAssumeNetAddress is turned on.
     - Fixed history saving commands that were quoted paths alone
       multiple times
     - Fixed multiple explorer windows

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Added following RC Commands (see section II.2 for details)

       * CommandExplorePaths

   Version 1.5.2
   -------------
   More bug fixes - most related to string parsing and memory
   allocation.  Programmers: forgive me!  I didn't check all the
   NULL pointers I was supposed to!  I only hope I caught all of
   them in this release...

   Quote of the release: What was I smoking when I released 1.5.1
   anyway?

     Bug Fixes
     `````````
     - Fixed Calculator () crashing bug
     - Fixed multiple history menu entries of same command
     - Fixed times when history menu wouldn't do anything
     - Fixed No-Argument searching (not possible now)
     - Fixed case when CommandNewestHistoryItemsOnTop was *not* on
     - Fixed LSXCommand hiding / showing itself on inappropriate
       commands from the context menu
     - Fixed command parsing by rewriting code - woopee!!

     New Features
     ````````````
     - Totally re-written command parser  (This is also a bug fix)
     - Added following engines:

       * IMDB	- Search for movies by title at imdb.com

     Notes
     `````
     This section will just comment on the new command parser, since
     it's not big enough for it's own section.

     The new command parser allows for anything to be quoted.
     However, do NOT try and use quoted names for aliases and search
     engines in your configuration files yet - they just aren't
     implemented.  I want this release to entirely stabilize before
     adding other features and moving on to other stuff for a while.

     Anyway, back to the parser.  Before, things like this would not
     run: (Let's say you have an alias of: nt notepad)

       "nt" c:\litestep\step.rc <ENTER>
       "nt c:\litestep\step.rc" <ENTER>

     The first, now, *will* run.  The second *will NOT* run.  This
     should be obvious: the first explicitly says nt is a command
     of its own.  The second says the whole line is a command of its
     own.  Since there is no command that fits this at all, nothing
     will happen.

     Also, quoted paths are now allowed.  So, you can now use

       "c:\program files\something"

     to launch files.

     LSXCommand now operates in the following fashion when given a
     command:

       - Try against Aliases
       - See if it fits !Bang / Calculator / Search
       - If not, try to execute the command and parsed arguments
       - If this does not work, but the command *was* a path,
         then try the whole line alone.  If it wasn't a path,
         your AssumeNetAddress setting kicks in and decides whether
         or not to launch your browser.
